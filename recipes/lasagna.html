  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
     Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type <br>
     of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several <br>
     layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats <br>
     and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.
  </p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    1 pound sweet Italian sausage
    ¾ pound lean ground beef
    ½ cup minced onion
    2 cloves garlic, crushed
    1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
    2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
    2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
    ½ cup water
    2 tablespoons white sugar
    4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
    1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves
    1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste
    1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
    ½ teaspoon fennel seeds
    ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
    12 lasagna noodles
    16 ounces ricotta cheese
    1 egg
    ¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced
    ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all your ingredients.
    <li>
      Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat <br>
      until well browned.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with <br>
      sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel <br>
      seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
    </li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in <br>
      boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
    <li>
      In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons <br>
      parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>
      To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch <br>
      baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of <br>
      the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. <br>
      Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan <br>
      cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover <br>
      with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make <br>
      sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an <br>
      additional 25 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>
